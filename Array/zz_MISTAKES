// In symmetric.cpp
//// In the question, the input does not have spaces in between different numbers of the array
//// so when we use int mat[][] then it takes the whole first line as a single entry, but when //// we use char mat[][] the different letters of each line are taken as single entries.

// Left or Right
//// If we enter a character in int, it will not read it. It won't just automatically take its ASCII value.
//// But if we put a integer in character it will take the ASCII value of the integer.
