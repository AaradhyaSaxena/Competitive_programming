/*
According to the definition of Greatest Common Divisior, 
if m is any integer, then gcd(a + m * b, b) = gcd(a, b). 
(In this particular problem m = 1 or m = -1 in each step.) 
Therefore, the gcd of (a + b, b), (a, a + b), (a - b, b) and (a, a - b) 
will be the same as the gcd of (a, b). Therefore, in order to move to the target point, 
the gcd of the target point should be equal to the gcd of the starting point.
